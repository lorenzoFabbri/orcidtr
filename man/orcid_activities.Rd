\usage{
orcid_activities(orcid_id, token = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{orcid_id}{Character string. A valid ORCID identifier in the format
XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX. Can also handle URLs like https://orcid.org/XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX.}

\item{token}{Character string or NULL. Optional API token for authenticated
requests. If NULL (default), checks the ORCID_TOKEN environment variable.}
}
\value{
A named list with data.table elements for each activity section:
\describe{
\item{distinctions}{Distinctions/awards summary}
\item{educations}{Education history summary}
\item{employments}{Employment history summary}
\item{invited_positions}{Invited positions summary}
\item{memberships}{Professional memberships summary}
\item{qualifications}{Qualifications/licenses summary}
\item{services}{Service activities summary}
\item{fundings}{Funding records summary}
\item{peer_reviews}{Peer review activities summary}
\item{research_resources}{Research resources summary}
\item{works}{Works/publications summary}
}
Empty data.tables are returned for sections with no data.
}
\description{
Fetches a comprehensive summary of all activities for an ORCID identifier
in a single API call. This is more efficient than calling individual
endpoints when you need multiple activity types.
}
\details{
This function queries the ORCID public API endpoint:
\code{https://pub.orcid.org/v3.0/{orcid-id}/activities}

This endpoint provides summary information for all activity types in a
single request, which is more efficient than making multiple individual
requests. However, the summaries contain less detail than the full
individual records.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Fetch all activities
activities <- orcid_activities("0000-0002-1825-0097")
names(activities)

# Access specific sections
activities$works
activities$employments
activities$fundings
